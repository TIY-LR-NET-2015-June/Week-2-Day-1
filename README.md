Humans, Robots, and Pandas

1. Create a class definition for a Human, a Robot, and a Panda.\
2. All should have a "DisplayName" and a "DisplayGreeting" method. The name should return the value held in an instance variable "Name"
3. Robots should have a "StartUp" and "ShutDown" method. They should output "Started..." and "Shutdown..." respectively
4. Pandas and Humans should have a "Eat" method with an argument "food" which describes what to eat. It should then return "Yum, I ate {food}"
5. A Robot should have a property called 'IsTerminator' which returns if that robot is a terminator (instance variable)
6. All should have a "IsASleep" property which returns true/false if a panda and human is asleep and if a robot has been shutdown.
7. Pandas and Humans have a "GoToSleep" and "WakeUp" method.

Demo the functions you've created by creating different instances of each type you've made and calling the functions on them.

Harder Mode:
Identity any interfaces or Abstract Classes that are common to all or just 2 of the classes you just made for Human, Robot, and Panda. Create and refactor your code to use these interfaces.

Create a list that contains humans, robots, and pandas.
Create a list that can hold humans and pandas in them.
